    <h1>20 aug</h1>
    <p>I've been thinking about death. The common way of thinking is that death is a matter best left unspoken. Saying
        that
        you're interested in death means that you're a weirdo, a freak, need to be sent to a psychiatric joint, because
        well, how is it sane not to accept the life you were given? How can you not like life? Death is often associated
        with a demise, a defeat, it is the way of the weak. I am interested in death. I feel a strong curiosity
        regarding a
        what if. What if, after life, after our ash withers away, the human experience will actually become better? For
        the
        last "as long as i can comfortably remember" I wasn't really satisfied nor truly happy with the way my days
        rolled
        one after another. And what the mainstream audience will say to you in a time like this is: don't give up, never
        let
        suicide stain your mind and never give into those thoughts as they are evil and false. But why? Is it because we
        don't know what comes after our time on earth that everybody is so blood wrenchingly scared? Why is it so
        frowned
        upon to be curious and eager of a lack of living. I want to experience what comes after, because in all
        honestly, it
        is at times hard to imagine that the things I experience at a moment of severe pain could be even more intense
        if I
        were to experience them through death.</p>


    <p>I am ashamed of writing this. Through my upbringing and current environment, the people around me cast shame on
        my
        soul for allowing these thoughts to my mind. And yet, I cannot get rid of this voice in my head constantly
        reminding
        me of death, it keeps lurking and paralysing my thoughts, never to be fully cleansed. The weird thing about this
        though, is that this thought has accompanied me throughout my entire 19 years of living. Sometimes more than
        less,
        yet I cannot recall a time where it did not rest in my brain, comfortably waiting to slither back. I eerily
        remember
        the nights I laid in bed before even entering primary school (so around age 5 or so), when I let these "demonic"
        ideas take ahold of my curiosity, thinking about what hides behind the curtain of life. This coincided with the
        death of my grandmother, with whom I was very close at the time. I thought of suicide. At that time it did not
        seem
        frightening. I believed that my grandmother would guide me through death, the same way she guided me through
        life. I
        chose life at that time, as it held many promises - of fun, of memories, of emotion and fulfilment, but the
        thought
        of death did not go away.</p>

    <p>When I mention this story to people I know personally, they seem disgusted, perhaps also in slight disbelief. I
        think
        it is uncommon for children to experience death at such an early age. Death is hid from children, kept tucked
        away
        in the cupboard next to the condoms and alcohol they receive when they turn older. This circles back to the idea
        that thinking about death is sinful. But I object. It is unfair to be shamed for ideas that come to me
        naturally, as
        now I see, intrinsically this is what I am. I cannot wait to die.
